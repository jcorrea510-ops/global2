            <p class="text-center text-gray-400 mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">By the mid-18th century, several great empires dominated the world stage, each facing unique internal challenges and external pressures that would soon lead to their decline or transformation.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#00A6FB]">Ottoman Empire ca. 1750</h3>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">A vast, multi-ethnic empire centered in Turkey, controlling much of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Eastern Europe. By 1750, it was experiencing a significant decline in central authority, characterized by military stagnation (e.g., the Janissary corps losing effectiveness), economic challenges exacerbated by European trade dominance (capitulations), and a growing nickname as the "sick man of Europe" due to its increasing weakness against European powers.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">An Islamic empire that ruled most of the Indian subcontinent. After the reign of Aurangzeb, internal conflicts among regional rulers and successors, along with revolts by groups like the Marathas and Sikhs, led to its fragmentation. This power vacuum was increasingly filled by European trading companies, particularly the British East India Company, which began to exert significant political and military control.</p>

                    <p class="mt-2 text-gray-300">The last feudal government of Japan, which maintained a strict policy of national isolation (Sakoku) from the outside world. This period oversaw a long era of peace, internal stability, and a flourishing of arts (Ukiyo-e) and culture. Despite its stability, the Shogunate faced internal economic pressures, including an imbalance between the samurai class and a rising merchant class, setting the stage for its eventual collapse when faced with Western demands, notably from Commodore Matthew Perry.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">An intellectual and philosophical movement dominating the 18th century in Europe, emphasizing reason, individualism, and skepticism over tradition. Key ideas included John Locke's concept of natural rights (life, liberty, property) and the social contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's idea of popular sovereignty, and Baron de Montesquieu's advocacy for the separation of powers in government. These ideas profoundly influenced political thought and fueled revolutionary movements worldwide.</p>

Driven by Creole elites (American-born Spaniards) who were discontent with Spanish control and inspired by Enlightenment and American/French revolutions.

The **Unification of Italy** (Risorgimento) unified the peninsula into the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, led by figures like Camillo di Cavour (diplomacy), Giuseppe Garibaldi (Red Shirts, conquering Southern Italy), and Victor Emmanuel II, overcoming obstacles like the Papal States and foreign influence.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">The **Agrarian Revolution** (preceded Industrial Revolution) involved innovations like the seed drill, enclosure movement, new crops (potatoes, corn), and crop rotation. These improvements drastically increased food production, supported a larger population, and led to a surplus of rural labor, which then migrated to cities for factory work.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">The **Industrial Revolution** (starting late 18th century in Britain) was a profound shift from agrarian and handicraft economies to machine-based manufacturing. Fueled by coal, iron, and inventions like James Watt's steam engine and the power loom, it led to the factory system, mass production, rapid urbanization, and the rise of new social classes (industrial working class and bourgeoisie).</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#00A6FB] mb-4">Industrial Era Reform Movements & Ideologies</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">The harsh conditions of early industrialization (child labor, long hours, unsafe factories, pollution) sparked various **Reform Movements**. Labor unions emerged to advocate for workers' rights, leading to early Factory Acts aimed at improving conditions and limiting child labor. Socialist ideas gained traction as responses to the perceived injustices of capitalism.</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">**Communism**, notably theorized by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in *The Communist Manifesto*, emerged as a radical critique of capitalism. It advocated for a classless society where the means of production are owned communally, believing that history is driven by class struggle and culminating in a proletariat (working class) revolution to abolish private property and the state.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#00A6FB] mb-4">Irish Potato Famine (1845-1852)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">A catastrophic period in Ireland caused by a blight that destroyed potato crops, the staple food for much of the population. While a natural disaster, its effects were severely exacerbated by British government policies, which continued food exports and provided insufficient relief. This led to widespread starvation, disease, and mass emigration (especially to the United States and Canada), profoundly altering Ireland's demographics and its relationship with Britain.</p>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-[#00A6FB] mb-4">Meiji Restoration (1868)</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">A political revolution in Japan that effectively ended the feudal Tokugawa Shogunate and restored imperial rule under Emperor Meiji. This event triggered a period of rapid and deliberate modernization, industrialization, and Westernization. Japan adopted Western technologies, established a modern military and education system, and abolished the samurai class, all aimed at strengthening Japan to resist Western imperial domination and become an imperial power itself.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">British domination of India, initially through the British East India Company, which gradually expanded its economic and military control. Following the Sepoy Mutiny (1857), direct rule was established as the British Raj (1858-1947). Britain exploited India's vast resources (cotton, spices, opium), imposed a de-industrialization policy to make India a market for British goods, and built extensive infrastructure like railways to facilitate resource extraction and control. This had a profound and often devastating impact on Indian society and economy.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">China was weakened by Western powers (and later Japan) through unequal treaties, spheres of influence, and military interventions. The Opium Wars (1839-42, 1856-60) forced China to open to foreign trade and cede territory (e.g., Hong Kong) under the Treaty of Nanjing. Internal rebellions like the Taiping Rebellion and Boxer Rebellion further destabilized the Qing Dynasty, ultimately leading to its collapse. The Open Door Policy aimed to ensure equal trading rights for all foreign powers in China, preventing any single power from monopolizing Chinese markets.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">The "Scramble for Africa" (late 19th century) saw European powers rapidly colonize almost the entire African continent, carving it up at conferences like the Berlin Conference (1884-85) without regard for existing ethnic or political boundaries. Motivations included economic gain (raw materials, markets), political prestige, and the "civilizing mission." African resistance, though fierce (e.g., the Zulu Kingdom against the British, Ethiopia's victory over Italy at Adwa), was largely unsuccessful due to European technological superiority.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk led Turkey's War of Independence after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, establishing the secular Republic of Turkey in 1923. He implemented sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing and Westernizing the new nation. Key changes included the abolition of the Sultanate and Caliphate, the adoption of a Latin script for the Turkish language, secularizing education and law, promoting women's rights (e.g., suffrage), and fostering a strong Turkish national identity separate from its Ottoman past.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-sm">A popular uprising that overthrew the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The revolution was driven by widespread discontent with the Shah's authoritarian rule, perceived corruption, his pro-Western policies, and social inequalities. Led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, it resulted in the establishment of an Islamic Republic, transforming Iran into a theocracy based on Islamic law. The revolution had significant regional and global impacts, including the Iran hostage crisis.</p>

                <p class="text-center text-sm text-gray-400 mt-4">Since 1950, the world's urban population has exploded as people migrate from rural areas to cities in search of economic opportunities, leading to the rise of mega-cities. This rapid growth, coupled with increased industrial activity and consumption, has dramatically increased global CO2 emissions, driving climate change and posing significant strains on the environment including deforestation, biodiversity loss, and widespread pollution. The chart visualizes this concurrent increase in both urban population and CO2 emissions.</p>

This was achieved through the development of high-yield varieties of staple crops (like wheat and rice, pioneered by Norman Borlaug), coupled with the increased use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and controlled water supply. While it averted widespread famine and fed a growing global population, it also raised concerns about environmental impact (e.g., chemical runoff) and social equity (e.g., cost of new inputs for small farmers).</p>

The **Rwandan Genocide** (1994) was the mass slaughter of an estimated 800,000 to 1 million Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists over roughly 100 days, stemming from deep-seated ethnic tensions and political opportunism. The **Genocide in Darfur** (Sudan, beginning 2003) involves systematic attacks, killings, and displacement of non-Arab ethnic groups by government-backed Janjaweed militias, leading to a protracted humanitarian crisis.</p>

The **Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo** are an Argentine human rights group who organized in 1977 to demand information about their children who "disappeared" (were abducted and murdered) under the military dictatorship (1976-1983), becoming a powerful symbol of resistance and the search for truth and justice.</p>

By 1750, it was experiencing a significant decline in central authority, characterized by military stagnation (e.g., the Janissary corps losing effectiveness), economic challenges exacerbated by European trade dominance (capitulations), and a growing nickname as the "sick man of Europe" due to its increasing weakness against European powers. This decline continued for several decades until its dissolution after WWI.

This power vacuum was increasingly filled by European trading companies, particularly the British East India Company, which began to exert significant political and military control. This period of fragmentation continued leading to its eventual end with the rise of British colonial rule.

Despite its stability, the Shogunate faced internal economic pressures, including an imbalance between the samurai class and a rising merchant class, setting the stage for its eventual collapse when faced with Western demands, notably from Commodore Matthew Perry. This era ended with the Meiji Restoration in 1868.

Initially a social rebellion, it later became a conservative movement that achieved independence from Spain in 1821 under Agustín de Iturbide, though it left Mexico with significant social and political divides.

These improvements drastically increased food production, supported a larger population, and led to a surplus of rural labor, which then migrated to cities for factory work. This transformation spanned decades.

                            The **Industrial Revolution** (starting late 18th century in Britain) was a profound shift from agrarian and handicraft economies to machine-based manufacturing. Fueled by coal, iron, and inventions like James Watt's steam engine and the power loom, it led to the factory system, mass production, rapid urbanization, and the rise of new social classes (industrial working class and bourgeoisie). This revolution continued into the 19th and 20th centuries.

Socialist ideas gained traction as responses to the perceived injustices of capitalism. These movements developed throughout the 19th century.

This led to widespread starvation, disease, and mass emigration (especially to the United States and Canada), profoundly altering Ireland's demographics and its relationship with Britain.

The **Unification of Italy** (Risorgimento) unified the peninsula into the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, led by figures like Camillo di Cavour (diplomacy), Giuseppe Garibaldi (Red Shirts, conquering Southern Italy), and Victor Emmanuel II, overcoming obstacles like the Papal States and foreign influence. This process spanned roughly a decade, culminating in the complete unification of both nations.

Motivations included economic gain (raw materials, markets), political prestige, and the "civilizing mission." African resistance, though fierce (e.g., the Zulu Kingdom against the British, Ethiopia's victory over Italy at Adwa), was largely unsuccessful due to European technological superiority. This rapid colonization occurred primarily in the late 19th century.

This led to immense communal violence, mass migrations, and millions of deaths. This significant event occurred in 1947.

This system categorized and oppressed non-white populations, leading to mass resistance (e.g., Sharpeville Massacre, Soweto Uprising) and international condemnation. **Nelson Mandela**, a key anti-apartheid revolutionary and leader of the African National Congress (ANC), was imprisoned for 27 years. His release and subsequent election as South Africa's first black president in 1994 marked the end of apartheid and a triumph for human rights. This oppressive system lasted for decades, finally ending in 1994.

While it averted widespread famine, it also raised concerns about environmental impact (e.g., chemical runoff) and social equity (e.g., cost of new inputs for small farmers).
